# Dirty_Data_Project

The "dirty data" project is an designed to demonstrate the ability to take in 
messy data sets, clean them until they are appropriate for analysis, and then
undertake analysis on the cleaned data

The project structure consists of three folders each representing a different
task. In this case: Task 1, Task 3, and Task 4

Task 1 is an analysis of athletes data from decathlon competitions. 

Task 2 is an analysis of ingredients used for baking cakes.

Task 3 is an analysis of different bird sightings.

Task 4 is an analysis of popular halloween candy.

Each task folder follows the same structure:

A raw_data folder consisting of the original unaltered datasets

A 'cleaning script' in which the raw datasets are cleaned to be used in analysis

A clean_data folder where the cleaned data from the cleaning script is outputted
as a .csv file

And an analysis markdown file in whcih analysis is undertaken and the findings 
are summarised at the end
